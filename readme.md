Multiverse Miner [front]
=====================

Front-end redesign for Multiverse Miner. In similar fashion to Multivese Miner project, some of the art elements are not under open source license, however you can feel free to play with the code.

###Before you post an issue
It's an initial release (or alpha release if you prefer), not everything has assigned action to it, images are not optimized, some actions have no fail safe etc. Just keep in mind it may not be broken, it may just not be there at all yet.
